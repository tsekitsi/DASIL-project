#General Information:
This application utilizes the OpenLayers 3 API. It is an interactive, chronological map of the Grinnell campus, showing how it has been shaped and what buildings it comprised of, historically. The project is still underway and needs upscaling, to include photos of buildings from different eras, mass-produced onto the completed main mechanism. The final product will be a webpage, intended to be uploaded onto DASIL’s website, under the grinnell.edu domain and is expected to attract numerous visitors and amateur researchers.

#Populating with buildings:
When trying to pass text as string to be interpretted as HTML text, you need to express certain characters differently in order to differentiate from characters used in parsing. For example, if you need to write and display "Women's Gym" as the title, you'd need to type: "Women\'s Gym". This way, you are making it explicit that you intend the apostrophe to be simply another character in the title string.#
