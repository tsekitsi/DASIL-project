Populating with buildings:
When trying to pass text as string to be interpretted as HTML text, you need to express certain characters differently in order to differentiate from characters used in parsing. For example, if you need to write and display "Women's Gym" as the title, you'd need to type: "Women\'s Gym". This way, you are making it explicit that you intend the apostrophe to be simply another character in the title string.
